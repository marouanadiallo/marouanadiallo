## Hi, I'm Alpha-marouana DIALLO

I'm passionate about computer science, especially everything to do with web application analysis and design. Which leads me to say that I have a full-stack profile.

Being fullstack is good, but focusing and mastering some of the piramid is better, in my opinion. So, after careful consideration, I'm spending more time on JAVA|Spring backend palettes and the Azure cloud linked to this technology that I've chosen to master.
